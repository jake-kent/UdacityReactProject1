# MyReads Project

## Project Description

This React site is connected to a simple API and allows users to store information about books they know about on any of three shelves: (1) books they are currently reading, (2) books they have already read and (3) books they want to read. Users can search for new books to add to one of the three shelves described above and move books they've already added between the three shelves or remove them entirely.

## To run the project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* if you would like to start from a fresh dataset, update the string on line 8 of src/BooksAPI.js to something other than '1JQuKj4eLF'
